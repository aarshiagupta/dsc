    "The outcome of the sentiment analysis yielded a nuanced perspective, revealing a somewhat inconclusive sentiment distribution. Approximately 83.65 percent of the analyzed tweets exhibited a neutral stance towards Donald Trump. A discernible polarization was observed among the remaining 16.35 percent, with 7 percent expressing a negative sentiment, reflecting disapproval or discontent with Trump, while 8 percent conveyed a positive sentiment, indicating support or admiration for the former president. This breakdown illustrates the complex landscape of public sentiment, suggesting a considerable prevalence of neutrality alongside discernible expressions of both criticism and endorsement."
